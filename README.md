# "The Silver Tsunami" - an overview of the forthcoming wave of retirees from Pewlett-Hackard
## Overview - this report summarizes and describes the number and title of employees who will soon be retiring en masse from PH. The company needs to position itself appropriately in order to absorb the operational and financial impacts of this shift.
## Results
1. ### Employees Retiring by Title

The table below indicates that almost 30k Senior Engineers and an additional 25k senior staff members are nearing retirement age. There will be attrition at the engineer, staff, technique leader and assistang engineer levels as well. The loss of more than 50,000 senior professionals represents a huge loss of insitutional and technical knowledge that will not quickly be replaced. The financial impact of this many retirement packages may also be significant and the company should take steps to ensure it can absorb whatever impact that may be.

2. ### # Employees Eligible for Mentorship Program by Title
The second table (shown below) indicates that there are approximately 1,500 PH employees who are elgibile for the company's proposed Mentorship Program. 460 senior staff, 436 engineers, 264 staff, 255 senior engineers and assorted technique leaders and assistant engineers could receive irreplaceable knowledge and ability from members of the retirement pool before those older employees exit the company. The company must not lose sight of this opportunity to ensure appropriate succession planning.

3. ### More than enough mentors, not enough proteges
This report indicates that there are about 1,500 PH employees born during the year 1965. That is only about 3 percent of the number of employees who will soon retire from PH. At the Senior Engineer level, the number of employees eligible for mentorship is LESS than 1 percent. PH leadership should seriously consider expanding the eligibility pool to include employees born AFTER the year 1965. 

4. ### Incentives for Mentorship Participation & Financial Impacts Caused by the Loss of 55,000+ Employees
PH leadership should consider expanding this analysis to include financial information including salary increases and/or performance bonuses for employees who choose to enroll in the Mentorship Program. PH leadership should also make an effort to link the performance of the 55,000+ senior engineers and senior staff to the profitability of the company. What financial impacts will their mass departure have on PH? It's easy to speculate that the impact could be severe, but a more detailed and thorough analysis could identify specific impacts. 

## Summary
This analysis has revealed that over 55,000 roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to strike PH. Currently, as also revealed in this analysis, there are not enough proteges eligible for the mentorship program. The company should expand the eligibility requirements beyond the year 1965, perhaps to include the entire decade of the 1960s. I ran an additional query that tried to capture the number of employees with birthdate anyhwere in the decade of the 1960s and uncovered numbers that are probably more appropriate for PH needs (See table below):

The numbers of employees elgibile for mentorship is far more appropriate when not limited to just those born in 1965.
